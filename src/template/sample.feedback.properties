# You can define the tools to run using an Ant pattern, either a '*' for all,
# or a comma-separated list of individual tools.
# For a list of available tools, look in ${glean.home}/tool, 
# or see http://jbrugge.com/glean/tools.html
# The default set of tools is just a starting point for basic feedback.
tool.pattern        = java2html14,javadoc,javancss,pmd

# Collector tools are those that use the output of the other tools to provide
# some type of aggregate feedback. These will run after the tools defined above.
# Examples of collector tools are 'qalab', 'xradar' and 'dashboard'.
# You can specify them using the same pattern style as for tool.pattern.
# To not run any of them, use the value "none".
collector.pattern   = none

# Define the base of the project as an absolute path, not relative
project.root        = ${feedback.script.dir}/sample/SampleProject

# Uncomment and change these to match your project layout
#src.dir             = ${project.root}/src
#bin.dir             = ${project.root}/bin
#lib.dir             = ${project.root}/lib
#resources.dir       = ${project.root}/src

# The default name of the source project will be the last directory found in the
# project.root path. For example, if ${project.root} = /path/to/myproject, then
# ${src.project.name} will be 'myprojecct'.
# If you want a more descriptive name, define it here
#src.project.name    = MyProjectName

# If you want to change where the output goes, change that here.
#gen.report.root     = ${project.root}/glean

# Some Javadoc properties you may want to customize
#report.title        = ${src.project.name}
#report.header       = ${src.project.name}
#report.footer       = Generated on ${tool.timestamp}
