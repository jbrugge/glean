<h1>Introduction</h1>
<hr/>
CodeFeedback is a tool for generating feedback on a team's source code.
It is a small framework or Ant scripts that let you plug in different tools
that analyze, document or measure different aspects of your code.

Being a framework, the goal of CodeFeedback is to package some common tools and
tasks and let you apply them to any set of source code that you have. The HTML
results are packaged up for deploying to a common area for project reference.
Make it part of a daily build cycle and have up-to-date documentation and metrics
that is 

The basic setup includes scripts for a number of different open-source tools
that provide basic code analysis, documentation and metrics. There are other
scripts you can add for such areas as test code coverage or ??,
and instructions for how to quickly add others.

<h1>Using CodeFeedback</h1>
<hr/>
Supppose you have a project with a file layout like this:
<pre>
    myproject
        src
        bin
        lib
        ...
</pre>

Unpack the CodeFeedback files to a directory anywhere you with.
From a command prompt, go to that directory and run this command:
<pre>
    ant -Dproject.root=/path/to/myproject
</pre>

This will run all of the tools in the basic setup. The results will be simple HTML
files that you can distribute in any number of ways.

<h1>Publishing The Results</h1>
<hr/>
The results will, by default, be generated as subdirectories under myproject/reports,
one subdirectory per tool. The script will also package all of them up as a WAR
that can be deployed to a simple servlet engine. Or the files can simply be copied
to the documentation area of a simple web server to be served up for your team.

Direct access to the results
    myprojects/reports/index.html
    
Packaging the results after running the reports
    ant -Dproject.root=/path/to/myproject package-reports
    
Run reports, package and deploy (see section on Property Settings)
    ant -Dproject.root=/path/to/myproject all

PREREQUISITES
<hr/>
Ant 1.6.5
JDK 1.4

<h1>Configuring</h1>
<hr/>
The basic use of CodeFeedback assumes a simple project structure like above, but
many other structures can be handled by adjusting properties that are used. The
key properties are in the file report.properties. Overriding their values follows
the rules of Ant property overrides. That is to say that you can choose different
levels of overrides.

    properties specified on the command-line with "-Dproperty=value"
    myproject/report.properties.local - settings that are specific to a particular
                                        user of CodeFeedback for myproject
    myproject/report.properties - settings that are specific to myprojecct
    codefeedback/report/(tool dir)/report.properties.local - settings specific to
                                        this tool for this installation
    codefeedback/report/(tool.dir)/report.properties - settings specific to this tool
    codefeedback/report.properties - default properties settings
    
<h2>Different project directory layout</h2>
<hr/>

<h2>Selecting reports to run</h2>
<hr/>
The "report.pattern" property determines which tools are run. It's value is a
standard Ant glob pattern. The default pattern is to run all tools.

<pre>
    report.pattern="*"
</pre>

To run a selected set of tools, list them out, separated by commas.

<pre>
    report.pattern="pmd,cpd,javadoc"
</pre>

<h2>Disabling a single report</h2>
<hr/>
If there are certain reports that you don't or can't run, you can remove them
in a couple of different ways.

<ul>
<li>Edit the build.xml for that tool and change the default target to "disabled".
   This is a target provided that does nothing.

   <pre>
    &lt;project name="cpd" default="disabled" basedir="."&gt;
   </pre>
   </li>
   
<li>Move the directory holding the tool script out of the codefeedback/report tree.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Customizing the look</h2>
<hr/>
The reports use a stylesheet called "reports.css". Change this in any way that
you want. It is based on a number of styles from the standard stylesheets that
come with Ant.
