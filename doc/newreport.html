<h1>Creating a new report</h1>
If there is a tool that's not included here that you want to run, just provide
a build script in the right place, and the framework will pick it up. A template
for this is provided in the <code>template</code> folder. The steps below point
out the places where you can put in pieces specific to the tool.

<ul>
<li>Create a directory for the report under <code>report</code> and put a 
<code>build.xml</code> file there. If you like, there is a <code>template</code>
folder that you can use as a starting point with a commented <code>build.xml</code>.
<pre>
cp -r template report/myreport
</pre>
<div class="note">Hmm, except that the .svn folder also comes along...</div>
</li>
<li>Create a one-line description. This will show up in the home page of the report
package.</li>
<li>Have a <code>report</code> task that sandwiches your tool's task between
the tasks <code>init</code> and <code>transform</code>, both of which are defined
by the framework.</li>
<li>Include the <code>reports-common.xml</code> file. This has the property
definitions, tasks and macrodefs that are available.</li>
<li>If the tool has an Ant task, define the taskdef</li>

<li>Right the task to run the report. Here you have available to you a number of
useful properties.
<ul>
<li>${src.dir}</li>
<li>${bin.dir}</li>
<li>${gen.report.dir}</li>
</ul>
</li>
