<p>
Glean will create a summary page of the reports that were run for a project.
It is a simple table of links, the look of which is controlled by the 
<code>reports.css</code> stylesheet.
This stylesheet uses a number of styles pulled from the XSL that comes with 
the standard Ant distributions.

</a>
<p>
The output of the individual reports is usually defined by the tool.
Many of them produce XML output, and those stylesheets distributed with Glean
use the same <code>reports.css</code> stylesheet to produce a relatively consistent look.

<section name="Dashboard">

<p>
The dashboard gives a summary view of the different metrics reports. It requires
Groovy to run, so it is not turned on by default. 
See <a href="./using.html#dashboard">the notes on setting up the dashboard</a> 
for more on configuring it.
