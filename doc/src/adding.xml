<section name="Adding New Feedback Tools">
<p>
Any tool that you can invoke from Ant, either as a task or as an executable,
is a potential feedback tool to add to Glean.
The framework it sits within is simple, and getting a basic running script
is usually a short order.
</p>
<p>
To add a new tool to Glean:
<ul>
<li>Create a folder under <code>glean/tool</code> with the name of the tool.</li>
<li>Copy the <code>glean/template/build.xml</code> file to this folder.</li>
<li>Edit the <code>build.xml</code> according to the comments to add the pieces
specific to the new tool.</li>
<li>Test it out by including it in the <code>tool.pattern</code> property for one
of your projects</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
That's all there is to it. By placing the build script and folder in the right
place, Glean can find it and run it.
</p>
<p>
If you think the tool would be valuable to others as well, please 
<a href="mailto:john.brugge+glean@gmail.com">pass it along</a>
and I will include it in the next release of Glean.
