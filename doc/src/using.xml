<body>
<section name="Setting up your project">
<p>Glean needs to know only a few things to do most of its work:</p>
<ul>
<li>the location of the project files (source, binary and
libraries, if any)</li>
<li>which feedback tools to run</li>
</ul>
<p>Being Ant scripts, all of the config is done using properties,
and with properties files that allow you to apply settings to customize
a single project, a particular tool, or your entire installation. The
section on Configuring Glean, below, describes where and how you can
override the different settings.</p>
<p>For a particular project, try starting with a copy of the
<code>sample.feedback.properties</code> and changing it to describe your project</p>
</section>
<section name="Publishing The Results">
<p>The results will, by default, be generated as subdirectories
under <code>myproject/glean</code>,
one subdirectory per tool. The script will also package all of them up
as a WAR
that can be deployed to a simple servlet engine. You could also simply
copy the files to a documentation area of a simple web server to be
served up for
your team.

</section>
<section name="Configuration">
<p>The basic use of Glean assumes a simple project structure like above, but
many other structures can be handled by adjusting properties that are used. The
key properties are in the file report.properties. Overriding their values follows
the rules of Ant property overrides. That is to say that you can choose different
levels of overrides.

<section name="Selecting Tools To Use">
<p>The "report.pattern" property determines which tools are run.
It's value is a
standard Ant glob pattern. You can either use "*" to mean all tools, or
you can list them individually, separated by commas. The default
pattern is to run a small subset of the tools available.
</p>
<pre>tool.pattern="*"</pre>
<p>
To run a selected set of tools, list them out, separated by commas.
</p>
<pre>tool.pattern=pmd,cpd,javadoc</pre>
</section>
<section name="Changing the report look">
<p>The reports use a stylesheet called "reports.css". Change this
in any way that
you want. It is based on a number of styles from the standard
stylesheets that come with Ant.
