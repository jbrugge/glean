    <title>Glean : Gathering feedback from your code</title>
  </properties>

<body>

<section name="About">
<p>
Glean is a framework of <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> scripts for generating feedback on a team's source code.
Glean's goal is to make it possible to add feedback to your build cycle
with as little pain as possible.
The scripts create HTML that you can deploy to a project website or some other common team area.
Add it at the end of a daily build cycle and it is a quick way to keep a number 
of feedback sources up to date and in one place.
</p><p>
There are any number of feedback tools that have Ant tasks, but applying them
individually to your project build script usually involves copying some boilerplate
Ant target from the tool's documentation and tweaking it a little for your project.
Of course, even that doesn't help when you move on to the
next project, other than now having a new place to copy and paste. And as you find
more areas where another feedback tool would help, it adds an organizing challenge to the
build script maintainer to figure out where to put the script for this new tool.
</p><p>
Glean is a collection of these boilerplate Ant targets, tied together with some
common properties that describe your source project.
The goal is to give you flexibility in a couple of different directions: to let 
you plug in different tools that analyze, document or measure your code, and 
to let you apply those tools to any source project you have. 
</p><p>
Glean includes scripts for <a href="./tools.html">a set of open-source tools</a>
that provide a wide range of code analysis, documentation and metrics. 
When you want to expand on that, there are a number of other scripts you can 
add for such areas as test code coverage, UML generation or database documentation.
And if you have a tool you use that isn't here, it's not that hard to 
<a href="./adding.html">add a new tool script to Glean</a>.

<section name="Getting Started">
<p>
<a href="./download.html">Download</a> and unpack the distribution anywhere you would like.
The pre-requisites for running the basic scripts are a basic Ant setup.
<ul>
<li>Java JDK 1.4</li>
<li>Ant 1.6.5</li>
</ul>
Many of the other tools may have their own dependencies. Those scripted by Glean
are listed on the <a href="./reports.html">tools</a> page.
</p>
<p>
Running Glean involves telling it where your project is and what tools you want
to run. The defaults will give you some of the staple feedback for a basic component
project. To run it from the command-line, simply point it at a project properties
file.
<ul>
<li><code>cd /path/to/glean</code></li>
<li>To let Glean know where you have feedback tools installed locally, there is a 
<code>toolhome.properties</code> file. To override the values defined here,
create a <code>toolhome.properties.local</code> file with the specifics of your
environment.</li>
<li><code>cp template/sample.feedback.properties /path/to/myproject/myproject.feedback.properties</code></li>
<li>Edit this file to define where your source, bin and lib directories are, relative
to the root of the project. If the defaults work, you don't need to change anything.</li>
<li><code>ant -Dfeedback.properties=/path/to/myproject/myproject.feedback.properties</code></li>
</ul>
This will run all of the tools in the basic setup. The results will be simple HTML
files, along with a summary page. From a browser, open the file
<code>/path/to/myproject/glean/index.html</code>. The summary
should look something like this.

See the <a href="./using.html">documentation</a> page for more complete
instructions. Several types of project setups are shown on the 
<a href="./samples.html">samples</a> page.
