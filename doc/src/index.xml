    <title>Glean : Gathering feedback from your code</title>
  </properties>

<body>

<section name="Introduction">
<p>
Glean is a framework of Ant scripts for generating feedback on a team's source code.
The goal is to give you flexibility in a couple of different directions: to let 
you plug in different tools that analyze, document or measure your code, and 
to let you apply those tools to any source project you have. 
</p><p>
There are any number of feedback tools that have Ant tasks, but applying them
individually to your project build script usually involves copying some boilerplate
Ant target from the tool's documentation and tweaking it a little for your project.
Of course, even that doesn't help when you move on to the
next project, other than now having a new place to copy and paste from. And as you find
more areas where another feedback tool would help, it adds an organizing challenge to the
build script maintainer to figure out where to put the script for this new tool.
</p><p>
Glean's purpose is to make it possible to add feedback to the build cycle
with as little pain as possible.
The results of the scripts
are HTML that you can deploy to a project website or some other common team area.
Add it at the end of a daily build cycle and it is a quick way to keep a number 
of feedback sources up to date and in one place.
</p><p>
The core download includes scripts for a set of open-source tools
that provide a wide range of code analysis, documentation and metrics. 
When you want to expand on that, there are a number of other scripts you can 
add for such areas as test code coverage, UML generation or database documentation.
And if you have a tool you use that isn't here, the instructions on adding it to
Glean show you how to drop that one in.

<section name="Using Glean">
<p>
Supppose you have a project with a file layout like this:
<pre>
    myproject
        src
        bin
        lib
        ...
</pre>
</p><p>
Unpack the Glean files to a directory anywhere you with.
From a command prompt, go to that directory and run this command:
<pre>
    ant -Dproject.root=/path/to/myproject
</pre>
</p><p>
This will run all of the tools in the basic setup. The results will be simple HTML
files that you can distribute in any number of ways.
</p><p>
If your project layout is different than this, there are a number of ways to
specify that. (describe overriding areas).
</p>
</section>

<section name="Publishing The Results">
<p>
The results will, by default, be generated as subdirectories under myproject/reports,
one subdirectory per tool. The script will also package all of them up as a WAR
that can be deployed to a simple servlet engine. Or the files can simply be copied
to the documentation area of a simple web server to be served up for your team.
</p>
<p>
Direct access to the results
    myprojects/reports/index.html
</p>
<p>
Packaging the results after running the reports
</p>
<pre>
    ant -Dproject.root=/path/to/myproject package-reports
</pre>

<p>
Run reports, package and deploy (see section on Property Settings)
</p>
<pre>
    ant -Dproject.root=/path/to/myproject all
</pre>

PREREQUISITES
Ant 1.6.5
JDK 1.4

<section name="Configuration">
<p>
The basic use of Glean assumes a simple project structure like above, but
many other structures can be handled by adjusting properties that are used. The
key properties are in the file report.properties. Overriding their values follows
the rules of Ant property overrides. That is to say that you can choose different
levels of overrides.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>properties specified on the command-line with "-Dproperty=value"</li>
    <li>myproject/report.properties.local - settings that are specific to a particular
                                        user of Glean for myproject</li>
    <li>myproject/report.properties - settings that are specific to myprojecct</li>
    <li>Glean/report/(tool dir)/report.properties.local - settings specific to
                                        this tool for this installation</li>
    <li>Glean/report/(tool.dir)/report.properties - settings specific to this tool</li>
    <li>Glean/report.properties - default properties settings</li>
</ul>

<section name="Selecting Tools To Use">
<p>
The "report.pattern" property determines which tools are run. It's value is a
standard Ant glob pattern. The default pattern is to run all tools.
</p>
<pre>
    tool.pattern="*"
</pre>
<p>
To run a selected set of tools, list them out, separated by commas.
</p>
<pre>
    tool.pattern="pmd,cpd,javadoc"
</pre>
</section>

<section name="Changing the report look">
<p>
The reports use a stylesheet called "reports.css". Change this in any way that
you want. It is based on a number of styles from the standard stylesheets that
come with Ant.
